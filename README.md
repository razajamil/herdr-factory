![The work_to_pull_request belt: work sources drop items onto a conveyor that runs through work, evidence, review and PR stations, through a CI + human-review gate, to merge and teardown](docs/images/belt-work-to-pull-request.svg)

herdr-factory is an autonomous, worktree based, coding-agent factory built on top of [herdr](https://herdr.dev) that fits the workflow your team already has:

- **Plugs into your existing development process.** Jira tickets or GitHub issues in, GitHub
  pull requests out — through your normal CI and code review.
- **Full agent sessions, fully visible.** Every step is a real interactive session in a herdr
  pane — not a hidden sub-agent — so you can watch the work and steer it precisely when needed.
- **Local only.** No data leaves your machine: work queue, run history, logs, and even the
  opt-in telemetry stay on it. (herdr can also host the same factory on a remote machine — same
  guarantees, different hardware.)
- **Opinionated _and_ customizable.** A belt is an ordered pipeline of composable **step primitives**
  (`work`, `evidence`, `review`, `pr`, `custom`); the shipped `work_to_pull_request` template is the
  complete ticket → merged-PR flow, and you compose your own belts from the very same primitives —
  with the pipeline's typed inputs/outputs checked at config-load so a hand-built belt is as reliable
  as the shipped one.
- **Works with all your favourite agent harnesses.** Claude Code, opencode, pi, codex, … — if it
  runs in a terminal pane, the factory can drive it.

## Install

One command, macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razajamil/herdr-factory/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer is self-contained and idempotent: it ships everything the factory
itself needs (including its own Node runtime) and keeps it up to date. It also registers the factory
as a herdr plugin so each new worktree gets its [layout](#layouts) built automatically (when `herdr`
is on PATH; otherwise link it later with `herdr plugin link <checkout>`).

**You provide the tools the factory drives** — the same ones you'd use by hand:

| Tool                         | Used for                                                                                         |

Run `herdr-factory doctor` (or `doctor --deep`) any time — it checks everything above, plus the
supervisor, server, database, and each repo's config, sources, and evidence bucket.

<details>
<summary>Private repo / custom clone URL / uninstall</summary>

```sh
# clone over a read-only deploy key (writes the key + ssh config for you)
curl -fsSL <url>/install.sh | HERDR_DEPLOY_KEY=~/.ssh/factory_deploy HERDR_SSH_HOST=github.com sh

# uninstall (keeps your config + state; prints how to remove those too)
curl -fsSL <url>/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

</details>

## Quick start

The factory ships with a full TUI for configuration and monitoring — run `herdr-factory` with no
arguments to open it (live dashboard · config editor · doctor). Everything below can be done from
there; the steps show the underlying files.

### 1. Add your Jira credentials

Per-repo, in `~/.config/herdr-factory/repos/my-app/env` (`chmod 600`) — the folder name is what
you'll pass to `--repo`:

```sh
JIRA_EMAIL=you@org.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=...          # id.atlassian.com → Security → API tokens
```

(Jira is the walkthrough; a [GitHub Issues source](#github-issues--label-an-issue-get-a-pr)
needs no credentials at all beyond your already-authenticated `gh` CLI — add a `GITHUB_TOKEN`
line to the same file only if you want it to use a dedicated token instead.)

### 2. Point it at a repo and a project

`~/.config/herdr-factory/repos/my-app/config.yml`:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../config.schema.json
repo:
  path: ~/dev/my-app # the main checkout; worktrees fork from origin/main by default

work_sources:
  - type: jira
    jira:
      base_url: https://your-org.atlassian.net
      project: APP
      board: 254 # the Agile board id pickup pulls from (required)
      # status:         (defaults) — todo: To Do · in_development: In Progress · review: In Review
      #                  add `done: <status>` to move the ticket there when the PR merges (opt-in)

belt:
  - name: tickets-to-prs
    source: jira
    label: agent # tickets carrying this label are eligible for this belt (required — no default)
    steps: # the canonical work → review → pr pipeline (add an { type: evidence } step to verify visually)
      - { type: work } # no tab/pane → the factory spawns each step's pane
      - { type: review }
      - { type: pr }
```

Everything else — branch naming, budgets, concurrency — has sensible defaults. The first line is a
modeline: your editor's YAML language server validates the file against the factory's own schema
as you type. (`examples/example-repo/` has a fully annotated config, and running plain
`herdr-factory` opens a TUI with a built-in config editor.)

### 3. Feed it a ticket

Label a ticket `agent`, move it to **To Do**, and walk away. The factory claims it (→ _In
Progress_), spins up a herdr worktree, and runs it through the belt: **work** implements and
commits, **review** gates with fresh eyes (bouncing it back to work with findings if it isn't
right), **pr** pushes, opens the PR (→ _In Review_), and drives CI green — then the factory
watches the PR until it merges and recycles the worktree. The ticket's description, comments, and
image/video attachments are all handed to the agent as its spec.

### 4. Watch it work

```sh
herdr-factory                        # the TUI: live dashboard · config editor · doctor
herdr-factory --repo my-app status   # what's in flight, at a glance
herdr-factory --repo my-app logs     # tail the dispatcher log
```

## Markdown briefs — work without a ticket

A `local_markdown` source turns any folder of `*.md` files into a work queue: each file (or
subdirectory of files, for multi-file briefs with assets) is one work item, keyed by its name.
Drop a brief in and the factory picks it up on the next tick; the folder itself is never
modified. Two recipes — both can live in the same `config.yml`, alongside the Jira belt:

**An idea inbox that files the Jira tickets for you.** A belt of `custom` steps researches each
idea inside a worktree and creates the tickets — which your `tickets-to-prs` belt then claims and
ships. The factory generates its own work:

```yaml
work_sources:
  - type: local_markdown
    name: ideas
    local_markdown:
      folder: ~/factory/ideas

belt:
  - name: ideas-to-tickets
    source: ideas
    workspace_name: "research/{{work_id}}-{{work_slug}}"
    steps: # each `type: custom` step's prompt_file IS the whole body (the engine adds only a scaffold)
      - {
          type: custom,
          name: research,
          prompt_file: prompts/research.md,
          prompt_file_source: config,
        }
      - {
          type: custom,
          name: propose,
          prompt_file: prompts/propose.md,
          prompt_file_source: config,
        }
      - {
          type: custom,
          name: create_jira_ticket,
          prompt_file: prompts/create-ticket.md,
          prompt_file_source: config,
        }
```

The step prompts are yours, in `repos/my-app/prompts/`
(`examples/example-repo/prompts/work_generation/` has working ones); the run ends when the last
step signals done — no PR, no CI watch. `echo "Explore dark mode" > ~/factory/ideas/dark-mode.md`
comes back as a researched proposal, filed as tickets on your board.

**A spike lane — brief in, PR out, no ticket ceremony.** The same `work_to_pull_request` belt,
fed from a folder:

```yaml
work_sources:
  - type: local_markdown
    name: spikes
    local_markdown:
      folder: ~/factory/spikes

belt:
  - name: spikes-to-prs
    source: spikes
    workspace_name: "spike/{{work_id}}-{{work_slug}}"
    steps: [{ type: work }, { type: review }, { type: pr }]
```

```sh
echo "Try virtualizing the results table — does it fix the scroll jank?" > ~/factory/spikes/virtual-table.md
```

The full work → review → pr pipeline runs on the brief and hands you a reviewed PR.

## GitHub issues — label an issue, get a PR

A `github_issues` source turns a repo's own issue tracker into the work queue — no Jira, no
extra credentials (it uses your authenticated `gh` CLI's token unless you set `GITHUB_TOKEN`):

```yaml
work_sources:
  - type: github_issues
    github_issues: {} # all fields optional (repo defaults to the PR repo)

belt:
  - name: issues-to-prs
    source: github_issues
    label: herdr # the trigger label — issues carrying it are eligible (required, no default)
    steps: [{ type: work }, { type: review }, { type: pr }]
```

Label an issue `herdr` (the belt's `label` — its trigger) and the factory claims it — swapping the
label for `herdr:in-development` and **consuming the trigger**, so re-adding `herdr` later is how you
retry a run. The agents get the issue body, the whole comment thread, and any embedded
images/screen-recordings as the spec; the PR carries a `Fixes #n` line so the merge auto-closes
the issue (the factory closes it as completed anyway, as a backstop). A failed run leaves the
issue open, labelled `herdr:aborted`, for retriage; questions and attention notes arrive as
issue comments — reply in a new comment and the run resumes.

## Sentry — fix production errors

A `sentry` source turns a Sentry project's issues (production errors) into the work queue: the
factory polls Sentry on your filter, hands each error's **stacktrace** to an agent, and ships the fix
as a PR. There's **no trigger label** — the config query _is_ the filter, and belts route by
[`match`/priority](#multiple-belts) (like a `local_markdown` source):

```yaml
work_sources:
  - type: sentry
    poll_interval_seconds: 300 # Sentry rate-limits API polling — poll slower than the tick
    sentry:
      organization: my-org # the org slug (or numeric id)
      projects: [backend, web] # project slugs; omit for every project the token can see
      environment: [production] # environment names; omit for all environments
      query: "is:unresolved level:error" # any Sentry issue search (default: is:unresolved)
      # base_url: https://sentry.io          # or a region host (us./de.sentry.io) / self-hosted URL
      # on_merge: comment                     # comment (default) | resolve | resolve_in_next_release | none

belt:
  - name: errors-to-prs
    source: sentry
    steps: [{ type: work }, { type: review }, { type: pr }] # no `label` — sentry has no label concept
```

Credentials are a single token in the repo's `env` (`chmod 600`):

```sh
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=...   # a Sentry Internal Integration token (Settings → Developer Settings,
                        # Issue & Event: read + write), or a personal token with event:read + event:write
```

The agents get a materialized `task.md` — the error's title, culprit, level, event/user counts, and
the **latest event's stacktrace, breadcrumbs and request** (plus the raw payload in `issue.json`) — so
the work agent fixes from a real stack trace. Lifecycle is tracked **internally** (herdr-factory's own
DB, exactly like `local_markdown`): the factory reads Sentry but **never changes an issue's status**.
The one optional Sentry-side write is a courtesy note on the issue linking the merged PR (`on_merge:
comment`, the default); set `on_merge` to `resolve` / `resolve_in_next_release` to move the Sentry
issue's status on merge instead, or `none` to leave Sentry entirely untouched. (OAuth isn't wired yet
— a Bearer token only.)

## The belts

A **belt** pairs a work source with an ordered pipeline of **step primitives** listed in `steps[]`.
Five ship — `work`, `evidence`, `review`, `pr`, and the generic `custom` — each declaring its typed
inputs/outputs, its watchdogs, and how it can hand work back. A belt's lifecycle is **derived** from
what its steps declare: it gets the terminal PR watch because a step produces a pull request, the
bounce cap because a step declares a bounce, the `in_review` status write-back because the PR is
opened. There is no `belt_type` — the same primitives compose the shipped pipeline below and any belt
you build, and the composition is checked at config-load (a step whose input nothing upstream produces
is rejected).

### `work_to_pull_request` — feed it a ticket, get a merged PR

Pictured at the top. The canonical belt is `steps: [{ type: work }, { type: evidence }, { type:
review }, { type: pr }]` — the engine ships each primitive's prompt:

- **work** — implements the change and commits as it goes (a commit-HEAD heartbeat catches stalls).
- **evidence** _(opt-in)_ — derives a test plan from the work item's acceptance criteria, then films
  the running app to prove each one. It follows the repo's own skills/runbooks for the dev-server
  workflow **and** the login/test account so it exercises the flow as the right persona, drives
  `playwright-cli` for before/after screenshots and video, publishes the captures to S3/CloudFront,
  and records a per-criterion verdict table (with the public URLs) in its handoff. If the evidence
  doesn't prove a criterion it **bounces the run back to work** with findings. A flaky app that keeps
  re-capturing past `max_capture_attempts` parks for attention — but only as a backstop against a
  stuck agent: if the parked step then genuinely reaches a terminal — `step-done`, or a bounce back
  to work — the run un-parks and follows it (evidence is non-gating — the cap never vetoes a
  completed verdict, pass or fail). This station runs only when
  the belt's layout provides its pane (`tab` + `pane` in config; see [Layouts](#layouts)) — without one the belt is simply
  work → review → pr.
- **review** — a strict read-only gate with fresh eyes: it never edits or commits (if it commits, the
  run parks — read-only is enforced), it either passes the work forward or **bounces back to work**.
  Keeping all rework in the work step is deliberate.
- **pr** — pushes the branch, opens the PR with the evidence URLs embedded, and drives the
  automated round (CI green, bot comments addressed).

The run then enters the **reviewing watch**: one batched GitHub GraphQL query per tick covers
every watched PR, and whenever the review signature changes — new unresolved threads, newly
failing checks — a resolver agent is woken in the worktree to address them. The watch has **no time
limit** — it rides until the PR merges or closes, however long review takes — and it holds a
[`max_active_workspaces`](#limits-all-optional) slot **only while a resolver is actively working**,
so an idle PR-in-review never starves the belt of new claims. Merge → teardown (worktree removed,
branch deleted; re-claiming the same ticket later gets a fresh branch and a fresh PR). Closed
without merge → parked for [attention](#highlights).

Bounces are per-target-step counted; past `max_bounces` (default 6, per-belt override, `0`
disables bouncing) the run parks for attention instead of oscillating. Each station's engine
prompt can be augmented with your own `prompt_file` — see [Prompts](#prompts).

### `custom` steps — your own stations

![A belt of custom steps: a match router claims items onto a conveyor of user-defined stations, each holding its own prompt file, with an ask-human cord above; the last station stamps step-done and the run ends with teardown](docs/images/belt-custom.svg)

A belt whose steps are all `type: custom` is fully agent-driven — e.g. `research → propose →
create_jira_ticket`. Each custom step's `prompt_file` **is** the whole step body; the engine adds
only a handover scaffold (where you are in the belt, the prior step's handoff, how to signal done or
ask a human). With no step producing a pull request, the run has no PR machinery or CI watch and
ends when the **last** step signals `step-done`. Per step you can set `budget_seconds` and a
`heartbeat` (both off/default-safe), and the same worktree, handoff, bounce, and ask-human machinery
that the shipped primitives use applies — mix `custom` steps with `work`/`review`/`pr` freely, the
config-load dataflow check keeps the composition honest.

### Multiple belts

A repo runs **as many belts as you like, all ticking in parallel** — several belts on the same
source, belts across different sources, a shipped `work → review → pr` pipeline and a belt of your
own `custom` steps side by side. A belt can even **generate work for another belt**: below, a belt
of `custom` steps turns a folder of Markdown ideas into Jira tickets, and the `work_to_pull_request`
belt beside it claims and ships them — while a third belt runs experiments from its own Markdown
folder, entirely independently.

![Top-down view of three conveyor belts running in parallel on one factory floor. On the left, a belt of custom steps reads Markdown ideas and runs research → propose → file_ticket to generate Jira tickets; those tickets loop across to the middle belt — a work_to_pull_request belt on the Jira source running work → review → pr to a merged pull request. On the right, a separate belt reads a Markdown experiments folder and runs its own steps. A labelled arrow shows the ticket-generator belt feeding work into the Jira belt.](docs/images/multiple-belts.svg)

When more than one belt draws from the **same** label-driven source, each belt uses a **distinct
`label`** to carve out its own slice of the queue — the factory rejects two belts sharing the same
source _and_ label (they'd contend for the same items). So one Jira project can feed a `bugs` belt
(`label: agent-bug`) and a `chores` belt (`label: agent-chore`) that never overlap.

Within a single label, `match` gives finer-grained routing: belts are walked in `priority` order
(lower first) and the first belt whose `match` predicate accepts an item claims it — **first match
wins**, and a belt with no `match` accepts everything its `label` surfaces. `match` is a `.ts` file
in the repo's config folder whose default export is `(ctx) => boolean` (sync or async), with
`ctx = { item, source: { name, type } }` — the item carries `labels` uniformly plus source-native
routing metadata (Jira's status + raw fields, a GitHub issue's number/author/body, a markdown
brief's front-matter). Route bugs to one belt and stories to another, programmatically.

## Highlights

- **Zero tokens on the factory floor.** Polling Jira, GitHub or Sentry, claiming, watching PRs,
  liveness checks, retries — all deterministic code (native `fetch`, `gh`, `herdr`). Agents run only inside
  the steps, and the PR resolver wakes only when the review state actually changes.
- **The ask-human cord.** A blocked or unsure agent runs `ask-human`: the factory posts the
  question through the work source (a Jira or GitHub issue comment, or an inbox file for
  markdown sources), parks
  the run as `waiting_for_human` — **freeing its concurrency slot** — polls for the reply with
  backoff, then writes the answer into the worktree and resumes the same step automatically.
- **Bounce-back rework.** Evidence and review send flawed work _backward_ with written findings
  instead of patching around it; the work agent re-runs against the feedback file. The
  `max_bounces` backstop keeps a disagreement loop from running forever.
- **Attention is a workflow, not a dead end.** When something needs a person — budget exceeded,
  stalled commits, a closed PR, a pane that never appeared — the run parks: desktop notification,
  the pane relabelled `⚠ ATTENTION`, the reason (with a ready-made resume command) posted to the
  work source, and an hourly re-notify so it can't go stale silently. `resume <KEY>` puts it right
  back where it was, with fresh clocks — and re-prompts the step's own idle agent, so a step that
  finished but never signalled `step-done` completes on resume instead of quietly re-parking.
  Parked runs keep their worktree but hold no claim slot.
  A layout-pane wait self-heals before it ever needs a person: no pane means no agent (so no
  `step-done` could rescue it), so the engine re-attempts the spawn across a bounded number of
  extra wait windows — auto-un-parking a run already parked that way — and only parks for a human
  once that budget is spent.
- **Crash-safe by construction.** All state is on-disk SQLite and the reconciler is idempotent —
  a tick can be killed anywhere and the next one converges. The server is a coordinator, not a
  source of truth: every command falls back to running in-process when it's down, so a worker's
  `step-done` lands even mid-restart. Workers live in herdr and survive factory restarts. Source
  status write-backs **and S3 evidence uploads** are persisted intents, retried in the background
  until confirmed — an upload survives an AWS SSO session expiring mid-run instead of shipping a PR
  with broken evidence links (a persistent auth failure pings you to `aws sso login`, and the next
  tick auto-retries the moment credentials come back — it re-queues due-now instead of waiting out
  the backoff, so there's nothing to press).
- **Built to scale.** Active runs reconcile in parallel under per-run locks; Jira and GitHub
  traffic flows through token buckets (GitHub's is a process-wide budget) with
  `Retry-After`-honoring retries; all watched PRs share one batched
  GraphQL query per tick; claim admission smooths big-backlog cold starts; every subprocess and
  HTTP call is hard-timeout-bounded, with a wedged-tick watchdog behind it all.
- **Self-driving operations.** One resident server ticks every repo; a stateless scheduled
  supervisor restarts it if it's down, wedged, or outdated; auto-update ships new code (and new
  Node runtimes) within ~a minute of a push, draining gracefully before restart.
- **A control room.** Running `herdr-factory` with no arguments opens a full-screen TUI —
  live dashboard, a schema-validated config editor, and doctor. The dashboard's job table flags a
  run whose background work is stuck even when its steps read _done_ — e.g. an evidence step that
  finished but whose media upload is still retrying on expired AWS creds shows an amber `⚠` on that
  row. The server also exposes a local HTTP API (`127.0.0.1:8765`) with an OpenAPI spec at `/doc`
  and Swagger UI at `/ui`.
- **Observable.** Set `HERDR_FACTORY_TELEMETRY=1` for OpenTelemetry traces and metrics; a local
  Grafana stack ships via `docker-compose.telemetry.yml` (see [`docs/TELEMETRY.md`](docs/TELEMETRY.md)).

Deep engine internals (reconciler phases, locking, the outbox, rate limits, invariants) live in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## How it works

```
launchd / systemd timer ─every 60s─> herdr-factory ensure-up    (stateless one-shot supervisor)
                                          │ auto-update, then (re)start if down / wedged / outdated
                                          ▼
            herdr-factory serve    (one resident process: ticks every repo + HTTP API on 127.0.0.1:8765)
            │ Phase 0: flush pending source status write-backs (the outbox)
            │ Phase A: advance every active run one idempotent step (parallel, per-run locks)
            │ Phase B: claim eligible work — belts in priority order, first match wins, up to the cap
            ▼
todo ─claim─> worktree ─> step₁ → … → stepₙ ─┬─ work_to_pull_request: → reviewing ─merged─> teardown
              one agent per step;             │    (batched PR watch; resolver woken on new comments/CI)
              handoff notes in between        ├─ ask-human → waiting_for_human → same step resumes
                                              └─ custom: last step-done ─────────────────> teardown
```

Ticks are the level-triggered backbone (external polling, watchdogs, self-healing); a worker's
`step-done`/`bounce`/`ask-human` is an edge-triggered nudge that reconciles that run immediately
instead of waiting for the next tick.

## Configuration

Everything repo-specific lives in `~/.config/herdr-factory/repos/<name>/`:

- `config.yml` — the file described below (`<name>` is what you pass to `--repo`).
- `env` — per-source credentials, `chmod 600`: `JIRA_EMAIL` + `JIRA_API_TOKEN` (both required) for a
  `jira` source; `GITHUB_TOKEN` for `github_issues` (optional — without it the factory uses your
  `gh` CLI's token); `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` for a `sentry` source; `local_markdown` needs none.
  Strictly per-repo; there is no global secrets file.
- `guidelines-prompt.md` _(optional)_ — appended to every step prompt of every belt.
- Any `match` predicates and `config`-sourced prompt files referenced by `config.yml`.

The server discovers every folder under `repos/` that contains a `config.yml`; onboarding a repo
is pure data (`herdr-factory reload` picks it up without a restart).

### `repo`

- `path` — the **main** checkout (not a linked worktree; validated at load). `~`/`$HOME` expand.
- `base_ref` — what worktrees fork from (default `origin/main`).
- `github` — `owner/name` (default: derived from the origin remote).

### `limits` (all optional)

| Key                          | Default | Meaning                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max_active_workspaces`      | 3       | cap on concurrently **worked** workspaces (one per run); parked + idle PR-watch runs hold no slot |
| `attention_renotify_seconds` | 3600    | re-notify cadence for parked runs                               |
| `step_budget_seconds`        | 3600    | fallback per-step budget — used when a step sets no `budget_seconds` and its primitive declares no default (`work` 5400 · `evidence` 2400 · `review` 1800 · `pr` 3600) |
| `stall_seconds`              | 2700    | no new commits for this long → attention (heartbeat steps only) |
| `max_bounces`                | 6       | bounces to any one step before attention; `0` disables bouncing |
| `max_capture_attempts`       | 5       | evidence capture attempts per pass before attention (flaky-capture cap) |
| `tick_interval_seconds`      | 60      | reconcile cadence per repo                                      |
| `source_poll_interval_seconds` | = `tick_interval_seconds` | how often each work source is polled for new work; a per-source `poll_interval_seconds` overrides it. `≤ tick` polls every tick (unchanged); larger drains that source's backlog at `max_claims_per_tick` per **poll window** |
| `reconcile_concurrency`      | 8       | active runs reconciled in parallel per tick                     |
| `max_claims_per_tick`        | 10      | new-claim admission per tick (cold-start smoothing)             |
| `layout_wait_seconds`        | 600     | wait window for a configured pane; an expired window auto-retries ×3, then attention |

### `work_sources` (≥ 1)

Each entry: a `type`, an optional `name` (default = the type; must be unique per repo — belts
reference it), an optional `poll_interval_seconds` (how often this source is polled for new work;
overrides `limits.source_poll_interval_seconds` — handy for a rate-limited board polled slower than
the tick), an optional `max_active_workspaces` (default **2** — the most **worked** workspaces this
source may hold in flight at once, summed across every belt that pulls from it; belts are walked in
priority order and claiming stops once a source hits its cap, so `limits.max_active_workspaces` still
caps the repo total but no single source can monopolize it), and a type block:

- **`jira`** — `base_url`, `project`, a required `board` (the Agile board id, e.g. `254`), and a
  `status` map: `todo` (default `To Do`), `in_development` (default `In Progress`), `review` (default
  `In Review`), and an optional `done` (no default). Pickup is by the **Agile board** endpoint
  (`/rest/agile/1.0/board/<id>/issue`): the board's own saved filter scopes the query, and the ticket
  status + the belt's label narrow it. The label that flags a ticket for pickup is set per **belt**
  (`label` — see [`belt`](#belt--1)), not here. The status of
  record lives in Jira. By default the factory never writes a terminal status — merged/closed is left
  to Jira's GitHub integration. Set `status.done` to opt in: a merged PR then moves the ticket to that
  status at teardown (after the merge, before the worktree is recycled); a closed/abandoned run still
  leaves the ticket untouched. Ticket description, comments, and image/video attachments are
  materialized into the worktree for the agents. Authentication is **API token only** — `JIRA_EMAIL` +
  `JIRA_API_TOKEN` (both required) in the repo's `env` (the Agile board API needs Basic auth, so there
  is no OAuth).

  A source that **isn't authenticated yet** (no credentials) is *paused*, not broken: its claims and
  status write-backs hold, you get one notification, and it resumes automatically the moment it
  authenticates again — so an unauthenticated source never wedges the factory.
  `herdr-factory --repo <name> auth status` shows where each source stands.
- **`local_markdown`** — `folder`: a directory where each top-level `*.md` file _or_ top-level
  subdirectory containing at least one top-level `*.md` is one work item (key = filename stem /
  dir name; names starting `__` are skipped as still-being-drafted). Title/type come from YAML
  front-matter, else the first H1, else the filename. Lifecycle is tracked in the factory's own
  DB — **the folder is never modified**. A file materializes as `task.md`; a directory is copied
  whole as `task/`, so multi-file briefs (spec + assets) work.
- **`github_issues`** — polls a repo's open issues carrying the belt's pickup label (its `label`,
  which acts as the trigger — set per **belt**, see [`belt`](#belt--1)), oldest first; the status of
  record stays on GitHub, projected as labels. Fields (all optional): `repo` (`owner/name`; default
  = the repo PRs are opened against), `state_labels` (`in_development`/`in_review`/`aborted`,
  defaults `herdr:in-development` / `herdr:in-review` / `herdr:aborted`; created on demand),
  `close_on` (`merged`/`done`/`aborted`, defaults `true`/`true`/`false`), `type_labels` (issue label
  → work type; GitHub's native issue type wins when present) + `default_type` (default `Feature`),
  `max_pages` (pages of 100 per poll, default 1). Lifecycle: claiming swaps in the in-development
  label and **consumes the trigger label** (the belt's `label`) — re-adding it is the retry; success
  strips the state labels and closes the issue as completed (a backstop over the PR's `Fixes #n`
  auto-close — it never reopens); an aborted run leaves the issue **open** with the aborted
  label unless `close_on.aborted` (then closed as not-planned). The issue body, all human
  comments, and embedded images/videos are materialized for the agents; ask-human questions are
  posted as issue comments (reply in a **new** comment).

  ```yaml
  work_sources:
    - type: github_issues
      github_issues:
        repo: my-org/my-app # optional — defaults to the PR repo
  # the trigger label is the belt's `label` (below), not a source field
  ```

- **`sentry`** — polls a Sentry project's issues (production errors) and ships fixes as PRs.
  `organization` (slug or id) + `projects` (slugs; omit for every accessible project) + `environment`
  (a list of names; omit for all) + `query` (any Sentry issue search; default `is:unresolved`) are
  the pickup filter — there is **no trigger label** (the config query IS the filter, so belts route by
  `match`/priority like `local_markdown`; a belt on a `sentry` source must **not** set `label`).
  `base_url` defaults to `https://sentry.io` (region hosts like `us.`/`de.sentry.io` and self-hosted
  URLs work too); `stats_period` (default `14d`, suffix `s/m/h/d/w`) bounds how recently an error must
  have fired to count. Auth is a Bearer token in `env` — `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, a Sentry **Internal
  Integration** token (Settings → Developer Settings, with Issue & Event read+write) or a personal
  token with `event:read` + `event:write`. **No OAuth yet** (a Bearer token only). Lifecycle is
  tracked **internally** (the factory's own `work_items` ledger, like `local_markdown`) — Sentry
  issues are never moved for state. `on_merge` (default `comment`) posts a note linking the merged PR;
  `resolve` / `resolve_in_next_release` move the Sentry issue's status on merge instead, and `none`
  leaves Sentry untouched. `materialize` writes the error's metadata + the latest event's
  stacktrace/breadcrumbs/request as `task.md` (raw payload in `issue.json`). Because Sentry rate-limits
  API polling, pair a `sentry` source with a higher `poll_interval_seconds`.

### `belt` (≥ 1)

Common fields: `name` (unique), `source` (a `work_sources` name), `label` (the pickup
label — the tag the factory looks for to claim this belt's work; **required** for a belt on a
label-driven source — `jira` / `github_issues` — with **no default**, and omitted for a source with
no label concept — `local_markdown` / `sentry`), `priority` (default 100, lower = matched first), optional
`match` (see [Multiple belts](#multiple-belts)), optional `max_bounces` override, and optional
`workspace_name` — the branch/worktree name template, default
`{{semantic_work_prefix}}/{{work_id}}-{{work_full_slug}}`. It must contain
`{{work_id}}`; other vars: `{{work_slug}}` (≤20), `{{work_full_slug}}` (≤50), `{{work_type}}`,
`{{semantic_work_prefix}}` (fix/chore/feature). A short unique suffix is always appended, so
re-claiming a previously-merged item gets a fresh branch and PR. Optional `default_layout` +
`layout_matching` pick which `layouts` entry (below) the factory builds into this belt's worktrees —
see [Layouts](#layouts).

**`steps` (≥ 1)** — the ordered pipeline. Each step references a shipped primitive by `type`:

```yaml
steps:
  - type: work # implements + commits; the shipped work→evidence→review→pr template starts here
    tab: work
    pane: agent
    prompt_file: .herdr/work-notes.md # OPTIONAL: augments the engine's built-in work prompt
    prompt_file_source: repo
  - { type: evidence, tab: evidence, pane: agent } # opt-in: runs ONLY when given a tab+pane
  - { type: review, tab: review, pane: agent }
  - { type: pr } # no tab/pane → the factory spawns this pane itself
```

Per step: `type` (`work` | `evidence` | `review` | `pr` | `custom`), optional `name` (defaults to
`type`, unique within the belt), optional `tab`/`pane` (both-or-neither — with them the factory
targets the pane the belt's layout builds (see [Layouts](#layouts)), without them it spawns a
dedicated pane; `evidence` is **skipped**
when it has no tab/pane), optional `budget_seconds` (else the primitive's default — `work` 5400 ·
`evidence` 2400 · `review` 1800 · `pr` 3600 — else `limits.step_budget_seconds`), and `heartbeat`
(commit-stall detection; on for `work`/`pr`, opt-in elsewhere).

For `work`/`evidence`/`review`/`pr` the engine ships the prompt and `prompt_file` (+ required
`prompt_file_source`) _augments_ it. A **`custom`** step ships no prompt, so its `prompt_file` is
**required** and is the whole body — that's how you build your own stations:

```yaml
steps:
  - { type: custom, name: research, prompt_file: prompts/research.md, prompt_file_source: config }
  - { type: custom, name: propose, prompt_file: prompts/propose.md, prompt_file_source: config, budget_seconds: 1800 }
```

The belt's lifecycle is **derived** from its steps: a `pr` step (which produces a pull request) gives
it the terminal PR watch + the `in_review` write-back; an `evidence`/`review` step gives it a bounce
back to `work`. The composition is validated at config-load — a belt whose step needs an input no
earlier step or the source produces (e.g. `review` with no upstream `work`) is rejected with a clear
error. `evidence` and `review` are **read-only** (enforced: if one commits, the run parks).

### `evidence` (optional, repo-wide)

Where the evidence station publishes captures — omit the block and it still captures, assesses,
and can bounce; it just publishes nothing:

```yaml
evidence:
  bucket: my-evidence-bucket
  region: us-east-1
  cloudfront_domain: d123abc.cloudfront.net # bare host or URL; used to build the public links
  key_prefix: my-app # optional
  profile: my-aws-profile # optional named profile
  github_username: raza # optional; default = `gh` login at upload time
```

Non-secret pointers only: AWS credentials come from the ambient credential chain (`AWS_*` env,
SSO, `~/.aws`, or the named `profile`) — never stored in config or handed to an agent. Objects
land under `herdr-factory/<github_username>/<key_prefix>/<key>/<run>-<timestamp>/`.
`doctor --deep` verifies the setup with a real S3 write probe.

### Layouts

A **layout** is a herdr tab/pane arrangement the factory builds into a worktree the moment it's
created — the dev environment a worktree needs (agent panes, dev servers, editors, log tails). This
was absorbed from the [workspace-manager herdr plugin](https://github.com/razajamil/herdr-plugin-workspace-manager):
the factory is now itself a herdr plugin (registered by `install.sh`, or manually with
`herdr plugin link <checkout>`) that listens for `worktree.created` and builds the matching layout
into **any** new worktree — whether you created it by hand or the factory claimed a ticket.

> **Don't run another herdr layout plugin for repos the factory manages.** Because the factory now
> owns layout application on `worktree.created`, a second layout plugin — e.g.
> [workspace-manager](https://github.com/razajamil/herdr-plugin-workspace-manager) — would fire on
> the same event and build a competing (or duplicate) layout into the same worktree. Disable that
> plugin's mapping for any factory-managed repo, or uninstall it.

Define a repo-level library and point belts at it:

```yaml
layouts:
  - id: app-dev
    setup: { command: mise run setup, blocking: true } # runs once before the rest (blocking = wait for it)
    tabs:
      - title: work # a step with `tab: work, pane: agent` targets the pane below
        panes:
          - { title: agent, command: claude, setup: true } # the idle agent the step's prompt is sent to
          - { title: server, command: mise run dev, split: right, size: "40%" }
      - title: review
        panes:
          - { title: agent, command: opencode }

belt:
  - name: fix-tickets
    source: jira
    label: agent
    default_layout: app-dev # built into every worktree this belt claims
    layout_matching: # optional: pick a different layout per branch — first glob that matches wins
      - { worktree_pattern: "hotfix/*", layout: app-dev-hotfix }
    steps:
      - { type: work, tab: work, pane: agent } # dispatched to the layout's work/agent pane
      # …
```

- **Panes** — `command` runs once the pane is up. A step's `tab`+`pane` targets a pane by its tab
  title + pane title; that pane should run an **idle agent** (`command: claude`, `opencode`, `pi`,
  `codex` — anything that reports idle) so the step's prompt can be delivered to it. `split` is
  `vertical`/`right` or `horizontal`/`down`; `size` is a `"30%"` percentage, a `0<n<1` fraction, or
  an integer cell count. At most one pane may be `setup: true` — the layout-level `setup.command`
  runs there first (`blocking: true` waits for it before any later tab spawns).
- **Selection** — a belt builds its `default_layout`, unless an earlier `layout_matching` glob
  matches the worktree's branch. A hand-created worktree (no owning run) resolves by walking the
  repo's belts. Layouts are keyed to the repo by the config file (one config = one repo), so no
  repo path is restated.
- **Idempotent** — applied exactly once per worktree, and only to a **fresh** (1-tab/1-pane) linked
  worktree, so it never clobbers an arranged or restored workspace.

A step whose `tab`/`pane` names a pane the layout doesn't (yet) provide waits up to
`limits.layout_wait_seconds`; an expired window is automatically re-armed up to 3 times (a
transient herdr/layout race self-heals — even from an already-parked run), and only then does the
run park for attention. Omit `layouts` (and a belt's
`default_layout`/`layout_matching`) and steps just spawn their own dedicated panes — zero layout
setup required.

### Prompts

A step's body is the engine's built-in prompt for its primitive (per source type under
`src/prompts/`), optionally augmented by your `prompt_file` — or, for a `custom` step, your
`prompt_file` alone.
`prompt_file_source` says where it's read from: `config` = the repo's config folder (checked at
load); `repo` = the target repo's checkout, read from the run's **worktree at render time**, so
prompts can live version-controlled next to the code.

Around the body the engine always adds: a handover scaffold (which belt and step this is, the
full step sequence, the prior step's handoff note and pane/session pointer for on-demand
questions, the ask-human protocol, the bounce protocol where applicable, and the finish protocol —
write your handoff, then run step-done), your repo's `guidelines-prompt.md`, and token
substitution. Universal tokens (always injected):

`@@KEY@@ @@REPO@@ @@BELT@@ @@STEPS@@ @@STEP@@ @@TYPE@@ @@SUMMARY@@ @@BRANCH@@ @@WORKTREE@@
@@MEMORY_DIR@@ @@WORK_DOC@@ @@WORK_DOC_KIND@@ @@HANDOFF_IN@@ @@HANDOFF_OUT@@ @@PRIOR_PANE@@
@@PRIOR_SESSION@@ @@STEP_DONE_CMD@@ @@ASK_HUMAN_CMD@@ @@BOUNCE_CMD@@ @@BOUNCE_TARGET@@
@@BOUNCE_REASON_FILE@@ @@CLI@@`

Plus **capability-scoped** tokens, injected only when the step declares the machinery they belong to:
`@@EVIDENCE_DIR@@ @@EVIDENCE_UPLOAD_CMD@@ @@CAPTURE_ATTEMPT_CMD@@` appear only when an upstream step
*produces* `evidence` (so in a work → review → pr belt the review/pr prompts carry no evidence tokens
at all), and `@@CAPTURE_LOCK_ACQUIRE_CMD@@ @@CAPTURE_LOCK_RELEASE_CMD@@` appear only for a step that
declares an `exclusive_resource` guard (the evidence capture mutex), the lock name coming from the
guard.

Prompts also support **product-gated clauses** — `@@WHEN:<product>@@ … @@END@@` — kept only when that
product is active for the step (produced by it or upstream), otherwise the whole clause (prose **and**
its tokens) is dropped. That's how the shipped `review`/`pr` prompts reference evidence without ever
pointing at evidence a shorter belt never captured. Base prompts never name neighbour steps by name —
they reference prior/next work only through `@@HANDOFF_IN@@`/`@@HANDOFF_OUT@@` and the `@@STEPS@@`
sequence, so a primitive reads correctly in any belt order.

Everything a run reads and writes lives in `.memory/herdr-factory/` inside its worktree: the
rendered prompts, handoff notes, the work doc (`ticket.json`, or `task.md`/`task/`), attachments,
bounce feedback, human questions and replies, and captured evidence.

### Editor schema

`config.yml`'s first line — `# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../config.schema.json` — points
the YAML language server at a JSON Schema generated from the engine's own zod schema (so it can't
drift): autocomplete, required fields, enums (e.g. a valid step `type`), and unknown-key errors.
`herdr-factory install` writes it to
`~/.config/herdr-factory/config.schema.json`, and the resident `serve` process **rewrites it on every
startup** — so an auto-update (which restarts the server onto the new code) keeps the installed schema
in lock-step with the running engine automatically; `herdr-factory schema` regenerates it by hand if
you ever need to. A committed copy at the repo root serves the in-repo example (`npm run
schema`; a test guards it against drift). Cross-field rules — belt `source` refs, unique names,
tab/pane both-or-neither, `{{work_id}}` presence, file existence — are validated at load with
readable errors.

## Commands

```
# inspect & operate a repo
herdr-factory --repo <name> status | eligible | runs [--all] | timeline <KEY> | logs [n] | tick
herdr-factory --repo <name> claim <KEY> [--belt <name>]
herdr-factory --repo <name> teardown <KEY> [--source <name>]
herdr-factory --repo <name> resume <KEY> [--source <name>]          # un-park an `attention` run
herdr-factory --repo <name> auth status                            # each source's credential presence (no network)

# agent → dispatcher signals (rendered into every step prompt; you rarely type these)
herdr-factory --repo <name> step-done <KEY> <step> [--source <name>]
herdr-factory --repo <name> bounce <KEY> <toStep> --reason|--reason-file … [--source <name>]
herdr-factory --repo <name> ask-human <KEY> <step> --question|--question-file … [--source <name>]
herdr-factory --repo <name> evidence-upload <KEY> [--source <name>]
herdr-factory capture-lock acquire|release <resource> [owner]       # machine-global exclusive_resource lock

# the machine-wide server + supervisor (no --repo)
herdr-factory serve | ensure-up [--restart] | restart | reload | update | provision-node
herdr-factory install | uninstall | start | stop
herdr-factory schema [--stdout]
herdr-factory doctor [--deep] [--repo <name>]
```

The mutating/nudge commands (`tick`, `claim`, `teardown`, `resume`, `step-done`, `ask-human`,
`bounce`) route through the running server when it's up — a warm, in-process reconcile — and fall
back to executing directly against the DB when it isn't; reads (`status`, `eligible`, `runs`,
`timeline`, `logs`) always go straight to the DB. `--source` disambiguates a key active in more
than one source; `claim --belt` is required only when the repo has more than one belt.

`auth status` reports each source's credential presence (env-var presence only, no network). Every
source authenticates from the repo `env` — `JIRA_EMAIL` + `JIRA_API_TOKEN` for `jira`,
`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` for `sentry`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or your `gh` login) for `github_issues` — so there
is no browser login.

`serve` binds `127.0.0.1:8765` (override with `HERDR_FACTORY_PORT`) with the OpenAPI spec at
`/doc` and Swagger UI at `/ui`. `update` pulls the latest code (hard reset to the branch's
upstream) and restarts onto it — the supervisor does the same automatically every ~60s.

## The TUI

Plain `herdr-factory` (no arguments) opens a full-screen terminal UI built on
[opentui](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui). `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` switch the three tabs, number
keys jump to a numbered section, arrows move within it, `Esc` pops back out, `q` quits.

The UI is also fully mouse-navigable: click a tab to switch, click a section or row to jump to it,
and use the scroll wheel in any list. In the config editor, clicking a group toggles it and clicking
a text field starts editing; value controls (toggles, enums, add/remove actions) act on a second
click of the already-focused row, so a stray navigational click can't change a value. Modal choices
are clickable, and clicking the dimmed backdrop dismisses a dialog. Rows, tabs, and choices tint subtly on
hover, and the mouse shows a pointer everywhere except inside a text field, where it becomes a text
cursor.

- **Dashboard** — repos contain their belts, and each belt contains its active and eligible work
  items. `↑↓` navigates, `↵` opens a run's event timeline, `t` ticks, `c` claims an eligible item,
  `x` tears down, and `r` refreshes (mutating actions require confirmation). Empty belts stay hidden.
  Select a repo and press `d` to open Detail: general AWS SSO/source-auth diagnostics followed by
  configuration, work counts, and a live source/pickup health check for every belt.
- **Config** — a repo list `[1]` and a full `config.yml` editor split across four bordered panels:
  `[2]` config (repo · limits · secrets · evidence), `[3]` work sources, `[4]` layouts (the
  repo-level [layout](#layouts) library — nest into a layout to edit its tabs and panes; belts
  point at one via `default_layout`/`layout_matching`), `[5]` belts. The four
  panels are an accordion — collapsed by default, and jumping to one (number keys `2`/`3`/`4`/`5`, a
  click, or `↵` from the repo list) expands it and collapses the others, so only one is open at a
  time. It edits the YAML surgically (comments and the schema modeline preserved), validates against
  the engine schema, `^S` saves, `[`/`]` reorder list entries. Credentials appear as masked,
  replace-only `secrets (env)` fields —
  declared per source type (`JIRA_EMAIL`/`JIRA_API_TOKEN` for jira, `GITHUB_TOKEN` for
  github_issues, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` for sentry) — written separately to the `env` file (`chmod 600`).
- **Doctor** — the same checks as the CLI: `r` re-runs, `d` toggles deep mode (live herdr/gh/S3
  probes). The `herdr`/`gh`/`claude`/`git` presence checks resolve against the **service's** PATH
  (the environment the resident server runs its tools in), not the TUI's own — so they read the
  same whether you open the TUI from a terminal or a GUI launcher (Spotlight, a dock icon, a
  hotkey), which otherwise inherits only the bare system PATH.

The TUI renders through opentui's native core, which needs FFI — the launcher adds the flags and
resolves the same vendored Node the engine uses, so there's nothing to set up.

## Security note

Factory-spawned workers launch with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (hardcoded as `CLAUDE_FLAGS`
in `src/core/step.ts`) so the loop runs unattended. Each worker is confined to its own throwaway
worktree, but can run commands, push branches, and open PRs without prompting. Agents in
_your_-layout panes are whatever you launched them as. To tighten, change `CLAUDE_FLAGS`.

## Platform

- **macOS** — supervisor via a `launchd` LaunchAgent (`com.herdr-factory.server`).
- **Linux** — supervisor via a systemd `--user` timer (`herdr-factory.timer`; the installer
  enables lingering so it runs headless). glibc and musl (Alpine), x64 and arm64 — the installer
  verifies the vendored Node starts and names the missing system package if not.

## Development

```sh
git clone git@github.com:razajamil/herdr-factory.git && cd herdr-factory
pnpm install                 # Node ≥ 26 (.node-version pins 26.4.0)
npm test                     # vitest
npm run typecheck
npm run schema               # regenerate the committed config.schema.json
```

The engine is TypeScript run directly via Node's native type-stripping (no build step), state in
the built-in `node:sqlite` (no native modules). Design and invariants:
